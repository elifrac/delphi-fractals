# delphi-fractals
Fractal generation program in Delphi (windows)

This is a program I did 20 years ago when I was learning Delphi. Starting from Delphi 3 up to Delphi 7.

Some years ago after an HDD crash I lost several libraries and addins, so I could not build the project any more, and too lazy to look for the lost files.
I finally ported the project to Delphi 10.3 last year, but I had to remove a lot of extras to make it work.
All the fractals are working. You start by selecting fractal type from the menu or by pressing ENTER for the Mandelbrot set.
There's also a popup menu on the right click. 
PageUP / PageDown will give you a zoom box.
